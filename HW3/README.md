HW3:

This is the midterm review homework assignment.

In this homework I analyzed which features are best for predicting which emails are spam in the 'spam_dataset' 

The following models used include:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Lasso and Ridge
4. KNN
5. Support Vector Machines 
6. Decision Trees

I also used variations of each with and without cross-validation/StandardScaler()

Several of the models performed very well, mostly notable the linear SVM and the logistical regression, with both having test scores of 0.85
