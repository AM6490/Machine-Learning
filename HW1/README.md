Quick Overview of HW1:

This assignment does not have any machine learning in it, just some simple data analysis for two datasets. 

The first is the commonly used mtcars dataset, and the second is price data for Nvidia shares on the Nasdaq.

Some of the EDA techniques used include plotting histograms, scatterplots, and time-series line plots.
