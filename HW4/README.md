HW4:

In this assignment I experimented with various NLP and Neural Network models

The NLP models dissected various news headlines using a bag of words approach.

My objective here was to see if we could use a logistical model to predict which headlines were clickbait and which headlines were not.

I got an f1 score of 0.95, which is excellent. 

For the neural networks, I experimented with different numbers of layers and neurons to determine which model was best for predicting flower species based on different characteristics. 

Overall, I found that although adding more layers and neurons improves the model's accuracy, that is only true up until a certain point due to overfitting issues.
